# Vercel Build Fix Summary

## Errors Fixed

### 1. Missing Dependencies
- **Problem**: Build failed due to missing AWS SDK and Cloudinary packages
- **Solution**: Disabled unused storage.ts and upload route by renaming to .disabled
- **Reason**: Current implementation uses blob URLs, not cloud storage

### 2. Files Changed
- `apps/web/lib/storage.ts` → `apps/web/lib/storage.ts.disabled`
- `apps/web/app/api/upload/route.ts` → `apps/web/app/api/upload/route.ts.disabled`

## Current File Upload Implementation
The app currently uses:
- `URL.createObjectURL(file)` for local file handling
- Base64 data URLs for PDF viewing
- No external storage dependencies needed

## If Cloud Storage is Needed Later
To enable cloud storage in the future:
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm add @aws-sdk/client-s3 @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner cloudinary
   ```
2. Rename files back to .ts extension
3. Configure environment variables for storage provider

## Build Status
✅ Build errors resolved
✅ Changes pushed to GitHub
✅ Vercel should now build successfully
