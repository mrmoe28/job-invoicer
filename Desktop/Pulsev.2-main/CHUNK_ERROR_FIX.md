# Next.js Chunk Loading Error Fix

## Problem Summary

The application was experiencing JavaScript errors in the browser console related to chunk loading:

- Various JavaScript files like `page-786f77f99175d815.js`, `error-e9ca...`, etc. were causing errors
- These chunk files were likely from previous builds but still being referenced
- The errors were affecting the application's functionality, particularly the upload feature

## Root Causes

1. **Stale build artifacts**: Older JavaScript chunks from previous builds are still being referenced by the application
2. **Browser caching issues**: Cached versions of chunks may not match the current build
3. **Deployment inconsistencies**: Some files might have been updated while others remained in an older state

## Solution Implemented

We've implemented a two-part solution:

### 1. Client-Side Error Handler

We've added an `ErrorHandler` component that:

- Detects JavaScript chunk loading errors in the browser
- Automatically clears the browser cache when these errors occur
- Refreshes the page to load the correct chunks
- Prevents the user from seeing broken functionality

### 2. Build Cleanup Script

We've created a `clean-next.sh` script that:

- Removes the `.next` build directory completely
- Clears build caches
- Ensures a fresh, clean build with consistent chunks

## Usage Instructions

### For Development

When you encounter chunk loading errors during development:

1. Run the cleanup script:
   ```bash
   ./clean-next.sh
   ```

2. Rebuild the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### For Production Deployments

1. Include the cleanup step in your deployment pipeline:
   ```yaml
   # In your CI/CD configuration
   - name: Clean build artifacts
     run: ./clean-next.sh
   
   - name: Build application
     run: npm run build
   ```

2. Ensure the `ErrorHandler` component is included in the application layout to catch any remaining issues at runtime.

## Long-term Recommendations

1. **Consistent build environment**: Use the same Node.js version and package manager across all environments
2. **Cache busting strategy**: Implement proper cache invalidation for static assets
3. **Monitoring**: Add monitoring for JavaScript errors to detect these issues early
4. **Graceful degradation**: Ensure the application can function even if some non-critical chunks fail to load

This solution ensures users have a smooth experience even when underlying build issues occur.
