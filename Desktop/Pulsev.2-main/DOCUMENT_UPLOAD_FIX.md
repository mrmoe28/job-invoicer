# Document Upload Fix

## Issue Summary
The application was experiencing document upload errors with the error message:
```
Upload error: Error: Failed to upload document
```

This error appeared when users attempted to upload PDF documents through the CRM interface.

## Root Causes

1. **Incorrect Form Data Key**: The client-side upload function was using `formData.append('files', file)` but the server-side endpoint expected `formData.append('file', file)`.

2. **Endpoint Mismatch**: The client was sending requests to `/api/files/upload` but should have been using `/api/documents/upload`.

3. **Limited Error Handling**: The error messages from the server weren't properly captured or displayed.

4. **Vercel Blob Integration Issues**: The commented-out Vercel Blob code wasn't being properly activated in production.

## Fixes Applied

1. **Updated Upload Utility**:
   - Changed the form field name from 'files' to 'file'
   - Updated the endpoint URL to '/api/documents/upload'
   - Improved error handling for better diagnostics

2. **Enhanced Document Upload API**:
   - Added more robust logging
   - Improved Vercel Blob integration with proper conditionals
   - Added explicit directory creation confirmation
   - Utilized user and organization IDs from request headers

3. **Error Handling Improvements**:
   - Better parsing of error responses
   - More informative error messages in the response
   - More detailed logging throughout the upload process

## Testing the Fix

1. Navigate to the documents section of the application
2. Attempt to upload a PDF document
3. The upload should now complete successfully
4. Verify the document appears in the document list

## Additional Notes

- The fix maintains compatibility with both development and production environments
- Vercel Blob storage is now properly enabled when the `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_VERCEL_BLOB` environment variable is set to 'true'
- File system storage remains as a fallback option

## Production Deployment Considerations

When deploying to production, ensure:
1. The `/tmp` directory is writable
2. The Vercel Blob storage is properly configured if using that option
3. Database connections are working correctly for document storage

For any questions about this fix, please refer to the relevant code in `/lib/upload-utils.ts` and `/app/api/documents/upload/route.ts`.
