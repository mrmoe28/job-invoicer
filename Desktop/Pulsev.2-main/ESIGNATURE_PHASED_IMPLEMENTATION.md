# E-Signature Implementation Plan - Phased Approach

## Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Current Status)

Our initial implementation of the e-signature feature has encountered issues in production. Rather than continuing to push code that may not work, we're going to take a phased approach with proper testing at each stage.

### Immediate Actions

1. **Roll back to a stable version**
   - Focus on having the basic document upload and viewing working correctly
   - Remove features that depend on complex database integrations until we can test them

2. **Create a standalone test page**
   - Build a self-contained page to test document upload and viewing
   - Use local storage or simple JSON files for persistence initially
   - Verify functionality before expanding

3. **Document current limitations**
   - Identify which parts of the environment are causing issues
   - Define clear requirements for production deployment

## Phase 2: Core Functionality (Next Steps)

Once we have a stable proof of concept, we'll implement the core functionality:

1. **Document Upload**
   - Simple file upload with proper error handling
   - Local storage in development, configurable storage in production
   - Complete end-to-end testing

2. **Document Viewing**
   - Basic PDF viewing without signature capabilities
   - Ensure compatibility across browsers
   - Verify file serving works correctly

3. **Simple Signature Drawing**
   - Canvas-based signature drawing
   - Save signatures as images
   - Test in isolation before integration

## Phase 3: Integration and Advanced Features

After core functionality is stable and tested:

1. **Database Integration**
   - Add proper database schema
   - Implement migrations
   - Ensure compatibility with Drizzle ORM

2. **Complete E-Signature Workflow**
   - Integrate signature drawing with document viewing
   - Implement signature positions and placement
   - Add signature verification

3. **External Signing**
   - Add email notification system
   - Implement secure token-based access
   - Create external signing pages

## Testing Strategy

For each phase:

1. **Local Development Testing**
   - Manual testing in development environment
   - Verify all features work before committing

2. **Staging Environment**
   - Deploy to a staging environment that mirrors production
   - Test all features in the staging environment
   - Document any issues and fix before production deployment

3. **Production Rollout**
   - Implement feature flags to control availability
   - Monitor for errors and performance issues
   - Be prepared to quickly roll back if needed

## Current Status and Next Steps

Currently, we are rolling back to a stable version and focusing on Phase 1. We will not proceed to Phase 2 until we have a working proof of concept that has been thoroughly tested.

The immediate priority is to create a simple, working document upload and viewing system that can be tested in both development and production environments.
