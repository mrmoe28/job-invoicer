- Support for both development and production environments
- Environment variables for easy configuration
- Comprehensive documentation for maintenance and future development

## Next Steps

- Add support for multi-signer workflows with specific signing order

The e-signature feature is now ready for production use and provides a secure, professional way for solar businesses to handle their contract signing workflows.
