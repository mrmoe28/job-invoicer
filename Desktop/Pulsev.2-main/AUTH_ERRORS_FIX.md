# Authentication Errors Fix

## Issue Summary
The application was experiencing critical authentication errors with status codes 404 and 405 on the `/api/auth/session` endpoint. The client-side JavaScript reported:

```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
[next-auth][error][CLIENT_FETCH_ERROR]
https://next-auth.js.org/errors#client_fetch_error Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON
```

## Root Causes

1. **Conflicting Auth Implementations**: The application had mismatched authentication configurations between the App Router and Pages Router.
2. **Invalid Session API Response**: The custom `/api/auth/session` endpoint was not returning data in the format NextAuth expects.
3. **Middleware Conflicts**: The middleware was configured to handle specific auth routes instead of the entire `/api/auth` path.

## Fixes Applied

1. **Updated Session Endpoint**: Rewrote the `/app/api/auth/session/route.ts` to use `getServerSession` and provide a properly formatted response.
2. **Fixed NextAuth Handler**: Updated both App Router and Pages Router NextAuth handlers to use the same `authOptions`.
3. **Enhanced Middleware**: Updated the middleware to treat all `/api/auth/*` paths as public, allowing NextAuth to handle them correctly.

## Testing the Fix

1. Navigate to your application login page
2. Attempt to log in with valid credentials
3. You should be redirected to the dashboard without errors
4. Check the browser console to ensure there are no auth-related errors

## Additional Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility with both auth methods
- The development and production modes are handled properly
- Demo mode will continue to work as expected
